# 🎯 Number Guessing Game – Python Command Line Project

An interactive Python-based number-guessing game where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it within a limited number of attempts based on the chosen difficulty level.

Includes replay functionality for continuous fun! 🔁

## 🕹 Game Flow

1. Game displays a stylish ASCII logo

2. Computer generates a secret number

3. Player selects difficulty:

   - 🟢 Easy — 10 attempts

   - 🔴 Hard — 5 attempts

4. Player guesses the number with hints:

   - Too high

   - Too low

   - Correct guess wins 🎉

5. Option to replay after each round

## ✨ Features

✔ Random number generation (1–100)

✔ Two difficulty modes

✔ Attempt countdown system

✔ Instant feedback on each guess

✔ Replay without restarting program

✔ Modular code using functions

✔ ASCII art UI for better experience
